# Learning outcomes

1. [You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications]()
- [Project description]()
For my individual project I am going to make an application which moves files and folders to given locations automatically, sort music by genre autoatically and show which genres there are. 

 - [Front-end]()
 For the front-end I have chosen to use react. This because its widely used in the world and it has a large community. Because of this it's eassier to find solutions for some problems that I may encounter during the proces of creating the application.
 - [Back-end]()
 For the back-end of the application I chose to use Java, because it's a language that is commonly used in the software branch. Because I already have experienced working with C# I decided to work with Java so I can learn this language too. I will use microservices because i want to learn to work with that too.
